### Features & usage
- Built on the [official image](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis) to be used as a drop-in replacement. Comes with regular rebuilds and hardened_malloc which are standard among Polarix containers.
- Unprivileged image: you should check your volumes' permissions (eg `/data`), default UID/GID is 200004. We changed from the default UID 1000 as it often belongs to a `wheel` user.
